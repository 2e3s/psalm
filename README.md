## Introduction

Psalm is a static analysis tool for finding errors in PHP applications, and runs in PHP 5.4+ and PHP 7.0.

While some tools (like [PHP Codesniffer](https://github.com/squizlabs/PHP_CodeSniffer) and [PHP Mess Detector](https://phpmd.org/)) are designed to make your code adhere to style guides and make code easier to maintain, Psalm is designed to find errors that may prevent your application from running properly.

It can discover over 50 different types of issues that could break your application in both obvious and subtle ways. For example, here's what happens when we run Psalm on a small code snippet with a simple bug:

```php
// somefile.php
<?php
$a = ['foo', 'bar'];
echo implode($a, ' ');
```

```bash
> ./vendor/bin/psalm somefile.php
ERROR: InvalidArgument - somefile.php:3 - Argument 1 of implode expects `string`, `array` provided
```

### Why Psalm?

There are two main inspirations for Psalm:
 - Etsy's [Phan](https://github.com/etsy/phan), which uses nikic's [`php-ast`](https://github.com/nikic/php-ast) extension to create an abstract syntax tree
 - Facebook's [Hack](http://hacklang.org/), a PHP-like language that supports many advanced typing features natively, so docblocks aren't necessary.

Psalm's built-in function argument map is stolen wholesale from Phan, and its treatment of object-like arrays borrows heavily from Hack's.

So why should you use Psalm, and not those other tools? It comes down to coding style, and also your environment. If you have complete control over your stack, then you may well benefit from Hack's comprehensive typing support. If you're running on PHP7 and able to install custom extensions, Phan may be good for you.

Phan has one key drawback, as the `php-ast` extension's generated tree is designed only to provide information that PHP uses at runtime. It therefore omits some docblock comments that provide useful hints to the developer, and also to Psalm.

Nikic's [`php-parser`](https://github.com/nikic/php-parser) AST generator, however, creates a more complete picture of your code, and Psalm uses that (PHP-native) package in its representation of your code.

That means you can use typehints like

```php
/** @var string **/
$a = some_function();
```

and Psalm will treat `$a` as a string.

## Installation

If using [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/), simply run

```bash
> composer require --dev "vimeo/psalm:dev-master"
> composer install
```

### From source

```bash
> git clone https://github.com/etsy/phan.git
> composer install
```

### Requirements

Psalm Requires PHP >= 5.4 and composer.

## Configuration

Psalm uses an XML config file. A recommended default Psalm config is located [here](examples/psalm.default.xml).

### Options

- `stopOnFirstError`<br />
  whether or not to stop when the first error is encountered
- `useDocblockTypes`<br />
  whether or not to use types as defined in docblocks
- `autoloader` (optional)
  if your script that registers a custom autoloader and/or universal constants/functions, register them here

### Parameters

- `<inspectFiles>`<br />
  Contains a list of all the directories that Psalm should inspect
- `<fileExtensions>` (optional)<br />
  A list of extensions to search over. See [Checking non-PHP files](#checking-non-php-files) to understand how to extend this.
- `<plugins>` (optional)<br />
  A list of `<plugin filename="path_to_plugin.php" />` entries. See the [Plugins](#plugins) section for more information.
- `<issueHandler>` (optional)<br />
  If you don't want Psalm to complain about every single issue it finds, the issueHandler tag allows you to configure that. [Dealing with code issues](#dealing-with-code-issues) tells you more.
- `<includeHandler>` (optional)<br />
  If there are files that your scripts include that you don't want Psalm to traverse, include them here with `<file name="path_to_file.php" />`.
- `<mockClasses>` (optional)<br />
  Do you use mock classes in your tests? If you want Psalm to ignore them when checking files, include a fully-qualified path to the class with `<class name="Your\Namespace\ClassName" />`

## Running Psalm

Once you've set up your config file, you can run Psalm from your project's root directory with
```bash
./vendor/bin/psalm
```

and Psalm will scan all files in the project referenced by `<inspectFiles>`.

If you want to run on specific files, use
```bash
./vendor/bin/psalm file1.php [file2.php...]
```

### Command-line options

- `--help`<br />
  Display the list of help options
- `--debug`<br />
  With this flag, Psalm will list the files it's scanning, and provide a summary of memory usage
- `--config`<br />
  Path to a configuration file, if not ./psalm.xml
- `--monochrome`<br />
  Disables colored output
- `--show-info=[BOOLEAN]`<br />
  Show non-error parser findings.
- `--diff`<br />
  Only check files that have changed (and their dependents) since the last successful run
- `--self-check`<br />
  Make Psalm check itself (useful when making updates to Psalm)

## Dealing with code issues

Code issues in Psalm fall into three categories:
<dl>
  <dt>error</dt>
  <dd>this will cause Psalm to print a message, and to ultimately terminate with a non-zero exist status</dd>
  <dt>info</dt>
  <dd>this will cause Psalm to print a message</dd>
  <dt>suppress</dt>
  <dd>this will cause Psalm to ignore the code issue entirely</dd>
</dl>

The third category, `suppress`, is the one you will probably be most interested in, especially when introducing Psalm to a large codebase.

### Suppressing issues

There are two ways to suppress an issue – via the Psalm config or via a function docblock.

#### Config suppression

You can use the `<issueHandler>` tag in the config file to influence how issues are treated.

```xml
<issueHandler>
  <MissingPropertyType errorLevel="suppress" />

  <InvalidReturnType>
    <excludeFiles>
      <directory name="some_bad_directory" /> <!-- all InvalidReturnType issues in this directory are suppressed -->
      <file name="some_bad_file.php" />  <!-- all InvalidReturnType issues in this file are suppressed -->
    </excludeFiles>
  </InvalidReturnType>
</issueHandler>
```

#### Docblock suppression

You can also use `@psalm-suppress IssueName` on a function's docblock to suppress Psalm issues e.g.

```php
/**
 * @psalm-suppress InvalidReturnType
 */
function (int $a) : string {
  return $a;
}
```

## Typing in Psalm

Psalm is able to interpret all PHPDoc type annotations, and use them to further understand the codebase.

### Union Types

@todo describe how Union types work

### Property declaration types vs Assignment typehints

You can use the `/** @var Type */` docblock to annotate both [property declarations](http://php.net/manual/en/language.oop5.properties.php) and to help Psalm understand variable assignment.

#### Property declaration types

You can specify a particular type for a class property declarion in Psalm by using the `@var` declaration:

```php
/** @var string|null */
public $foo;
```

When checking `$this->foo = $some_variable;`, Psalm will check to see whether `$some_variable` is either `string` or `null` and, if neither, emit an issue.

If you leave off the property type docblock, Psalm will emit a `MissingPropertyType` issue.

#### Assignment typehints

Consider the following code:

```php
$a = null;

foreach ([1, 2, 3] as $i) {
  if ($a) {
    return $a;
  }
  else {
    $a = $i;
  }
}
```

Because Psalm scans a file progressively, it cannot tell that `return $a` produces an integer. Instead it knows only that `$a` is not `empty`. We can fix this by adding a type hint docblock:

```php
/** @var int|null */
$a = null;

foreach ([1, 2, 3] as $i) {
  if ($a) {
    return $a;
  }
  else {
    $a = $i;
  }
}
```

This tells Psalm that `int` is a possible type for `$a`, and allows it to infer that `return $a;` produces an integer.

Unlike property types, however, assignment typehints are not binding – they can be overridden by a new assignment without Psalm emitting an issue e.g.

```php
/** @var string|null */
$a = foo();
$a = 6; // $a is now typed as an int
```

You can also use typehints on specific variables e.g.

```php
/** @var string $a */
echo strpos($a, 'hello');
```

This tells Psalm to assume that `$a` is a string (though it will still throw an error if `$a` is undefined).

### Typing arrays

In PHP, the `array` type is commonly used to represent three different data structures:
 - a [List](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_(abstract_data_type))

   ```php
   $a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
   ```
 - an [Associative array](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associative_array)

   ```php
   $a = [0 => 'hello', 5 => 'goodbye'];
   $b = ['a' => 'AA', 'b' => 'BB', 'c' => 'CC']
   ```
 - makeshift [Structs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Struct_(C_programming_language))

   ```php
   $a = ['name' => 'Psalm', 'type' => 'tool'];
   ```

PHP treats all these arrays the same, essentially (though there are some optimisations under the hood for the first case).

PHPDoc [allows you to specify](https://phpdoc.org/docs/latest/references/phpdoc/types.html#arrays) the  type of values the array holds with the annotation:
```php
/** @return TValue[] */
```

where `TValue` is a union type, but it does not allow you to specify the type of keys.

Psalm uses a syntax [borrowed from Java](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generics_in_Java) to denote the types of both keys *and* values:
```php
/** @return array<TKey, TValue> */
```

#### Makeshift Structs

Ideally (in the author's opinion), all data would either be encoded as lists, associative arrays, or as well-defined objects. However, PHP arrays are often used as makeshift structs.

[Hack](http://hacklang.org/) supports this usage by way of the [Shape datastructure](https://docs.hhvm.com/hack/shapes/introduction), but there is no agreed-upon documentation format for such arrays in regular PHP-land.

Psalm solves this by adding another way annotate array types, by using an object-like syntax when describing them.

So, for instance, the method below returns an array of arrays, both of which have the same keys:
```php
/** @return array<int, array<string, string|bool>> */
function getToolsData() : array {
  return [
    ['name' => 'Psalm',     'type' => 'tool', 'active' => true],
    ['name' => 'PhpParser', 'type' => 'tool', 'active' => true]
  ];
}
```

Using the type annotation for associative arrays, we could evaluate the expression
```php
getToolsData()[0]['name']
```
and Psalm would know that it was had the type `string|bool`.

However, we can provide a more-specific return type by using a brace annotation:
```php
/** @return array<int, array{name: string, type: string, active: bool}> */
function getToolsData() : array {
  return [
    ['name' => 'Psalm',     'type' => 'tool', 'active' => true],
    ['name' => 'PhpParser', 'type' => 'tool', 'active' => true]
  ];
}
```

This time, Psalm can evaluate `getToolsData()[0]['name']` and it knows that the expression evaluates to a string.

#### Backwards compatibility

Psalm fully supports PHPDoc's array typing syntax, such that any array typed with `TValue[]` will be typed in Psalm as `array<mixed, TValue>`. That also extends to generic type definitions with only one param e.g. `array<TValue>`, which is equivalent to `array<mixed, TValue>`.

## Checking non-PHP files

Psalm supports the ability to check various PHPish files by extending the `FileChecker` class. For example, if you have a template where the variables are set elsewhere, Psalm can scrape those variables and check the template with those variables pre-populated.

An example TemplateChecker is provided [here](examples/TemplateChecker.php).

To ensure your custom `FileChecker` is used, you must update the Psalm `fileExtensions` config in psalm.xml:
```xml
<fileExtensions>
    <extension name=".php" />
    <extension name=".phpt" filetypeHandler="path/to/TemplateChecker.php" />
</fileExtensions>
```
